# Brief Introduction about PM2.5 Project

The PM2.5 Project aims to predict PM2.5 levels using a weather dataset gathered from five weather stations in Bangkok. Leveraging the scikit-learn library in Python, we conducted model testing with diverse algorithms to identify the optimal prediction model and refine parameters for accurate PM2.5 forecasts based on weather conditions. Subsequently, the chosen model was deployed on an AWS web server developed using Flask, providing a user-friendly interface for end-users to access and utilize the PM2.5 predictions.

### Key Words
<i> <b> Particulate Matters, PM2.5, Machine Learning </b> </i>

## Introduction to PM2.5
PM2.5, or Particulate Matter 2.5, is a critical measure of air quality that refers to tiny airborne particles or droplets with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or smaller. These minuscule particles can originate from a variety of sources, including industrial emissions, vehicle exhaust, construction activities, natural dust, and even chemical reactions in the atmosphere. PM2.5 is significant because it has a substantial impact on both human health and the environment. Understanding PM2.5 levels is essential for assessing air quality, making informed policy decisions, and implementing measures to safeguard public well-being.

### Global Perspective View on PM2.5
A global perspective on PM2.5 levels is vital to comprehend the scale and variations in air quality across different regions. By monitoring PM2.5 on a global scale, we can identify trends, sources of pollution, and areas where air quality may be particularly hazardous. This global view often involves the use of satellites and international air quality monitoring networks. It helps nations collaborate in addressing transboundary air pollution and sharing information to mitigate the impact of airborne particles on a global scale.

### Local Perspective View for Thailand
On a local level, such as within a country like Thailand, monitoring PM2.5 is crucial for assessing the immediate air quality conditions that people are exposed to. Local monitoring networks, government agencies, and environmental organizations collect data on PM2.5 levels to provide real-time information to citizens. This local perspective helps individuals make informed decisions about outdoor activities, and it assists policymakers in implementing measures to improve air quality and protect public health.

### Why do we implement PM2.5 Projects?
Protecting Public Health: PM2.5 particles are so small that they can penetrate deep into the respiratory system, posing significant health risks. PM2.5 projects aim to reduce exposure to these particles and thereby protect the health of communities. High PM2.5 levels have been linked to respiratory diseases, cardiovascular issues, and even premature death.
Environmental Impact: PM2.5 particles can also harm the environment. They can contribute to smog formation, damage ecosystems, and affect water quality. PM2.5 projects seek to reduce these environmental impacts.
Policy and Regulation: Monitoring PM2.5 is essential for setting air quality standards and regulations. Governments and regulatory agencies use PM2.5 data to implement measures to limit emissions from various sources.
Awareness and Education: PM2.5 projects help raise public awareness about air quality issues. They encourage people to take action to reduce their own contributions to air pollution and to advocate for cleaner air.

### Problem Statement

To predict the PM2.5 values based on given weather conditions and trends of the PM2.5,
Temporal Trends PM2.5 (seasonal, monthly, daily, hourly), 
Correlations between weather parameters and PM2.5, 
Weather effects (wind speed and temperature) on PM2.5

## Brief Explanation about our project work and related reports

In this repository, we developed a model to predict the pm2.5 using the Data based on Thailand. We used the data from 5 different datasets which are collected according to each localization data. The datasets  we utilized were declared in the dataset Folder. We performed various data preparation steps and methodology. You can find detailed information about the steps we took in our Jupyter notebook, which I highly recommend reading. 
Moreover, we deployed our model on AWS web server to allow easy access and testing. If you want to access a web version and perform testing with your own data, you can do so from the following link:

You can read the details of our working process in the <b> report </b> folder where we explain step by step details about our exploration.

## Summary
In summary, PM2.5 projects serve the vital purpose of safeguarding both human health and the environment. They provide essential information for informed decision-making, regulation, and action at both the local and global levels.

Thank you for your interest in our project.
